Tools Summary – Vulnerability Assessment

The following tools were used during the vulnerability assessment of the public website http://testphp.vulnweb.com. All tools were used in a passive and non-intrusive manner, strictly for educational purposes.

1. OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP was used in passive mode to observe HTTP requests and responses while browsing the website. It helped identify common security issues such as missing security headers, insecure cookie attributes, and information disclosure without performing any active attacks.

2. Nmap
Nmap was used to perform a basic, non-aggressive scan to identify exposed network services and confirm publicly accessible ports. No advanced or intrusive scanning techniques were used.

3. Browser Developer Tools
Browser developer tools were used to inspect HTTP response headers and cookie attributes directly from the browser. This helped verify security configurations observed during the assessment.

4. SecurityHeaders.com
SecurityHeaders.com was used to analyze the presence and configuration of recommended HTTP security headers and to assess the overall security posture related to header implementation.

5. Canva
Canva was used to design and format the vulnerability assessment report in a clean, professional, and client-friendly layout.

All tools were used responsibly and within the defined scope of the assessment.
